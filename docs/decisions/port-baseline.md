# Modern-port baseline features

The port distinguishes three categories (CLAUDE.md, Goal):
1. **Original behaviour.** Game logic, simulation, rules and content reproduce the original exactly.
2. **Modern-port baseline.** Features intrinsic to a PC port, built into the port. They may change **presentation only**, never game logic or simulation results.
3. **Everything else** that departs from the original goes only into the optional modding layer.

This file lists category 2. A feature is added here only after the User approves it.

## Approved

| Feature | Details | Related | Date approved |
|---|---|---|---|
| Output scaled to the host's screen, internal rendering resolution native (4:3 preserved, pillarboxing; 16:9 when the game's own SCREEN RATIO option is on) | two filters, **sharp** (sharp bilinear) and **smooth** (bilinear), chosen in `settings.json`, default **sharp**; the full 448-line draw buffer is presented (ADR-006 §4) | ADR-006 | 2026-10-10, filters 2026-10-11 |
| Frame rate decoupled from the simulation, with interpolation | fixed 59.94 Hz step, interpolated presentation | ADR-002 | 2026-10-10 |
| Frame cap | 60 / 120 / 144 / 240; **360 is the default upper limit** | ADR-002 | 2026-10-11 |
| V-sync on/off | presentation timing only | ADR-002 | 2026-10-11 |
| Window modes | **windowed** and **fullscreen** (a borderless window the size of the desktop; exclusive fullscreen not included). `settings.json` value `fullscreen` (`borderless`, the name used before 2026-10-20, is still read) | ADR-006 | 2026-10-11, naming 2026-10-20 |
| Settings in `settings.json` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ProjectStonehenge\settings.json`; settings struct + JSON load/save + change notification. Only port settings: the game's own options (brightness, screen ratio and position, captions, HUD unit, control type, vibration...) stay in the game's save data. A file that cannot be read, is not valid JSON, has another `version`, an unknown key or an invalid value is deleted and replaced with the defaults (User 2026-10-20) | ADR-005, ADR-006, `../port/port-features.md` | 2026-10-11, rejection rule 2026-10-20 |
| GRAPHICS page | last item of SCREEN SETTINGS, after HUD UNIT: the port's graphics settings (fullscreen, v-sync, frame cap, internal resolution, scaling filter), one row each with name, chosen value and choice squares, built from the game's own menu widgets as the BRIGHTNESS view. Every change applies at once; ACCEPT saves to `settings.json`, CANCEL restores the values the page opened with, the DEFAULT button sets the defaults for the display. With v-sync on the frame cap row is disabled ("V-SYNC", skipped) and the cap is not used. Game state unchanged | `../port/port-features.md` §3 | 2026-10-20 (immediate apply and the disabled cap row: User request the same day) |
| Anti-aliasing (FXAA / SMAA) | `presentation.antialiasing` `off` (default) / `fxaa` / `smaa`, GRAPHICS row ANTI-ALIASING, `--antialiasing`: FXAA 3.11 or SMAA 1x on each flight view's 3D, applied before the HUD is drawn so the HUD stays sharp; RGB only, guest RAM unchanged | `../port/port-features.md` §2, `../port/renderer.md` §1.8 | 2026-10-20 (User: "if SMAA and FXAA are compatible with GPL-3 you can proceed … add the HUD after the antialiasing pass") |
| Defaults from the start display | fullscreen; v-sync on at 60 / 120 Hz, otherwise off with the highest frame cap at or below the refresh rate | `../port/port-features.md` §1 | 2026-10-20 (User request) |
| SCREEN RATIO default from the monitor | on a monitor wider than 4:3 the game's own SCREEN RATIO option starts at 16:9 when no save data has been loaded (the port sets the option bit after the game's `InitOptionData`); a loaded save replaces it; setting `presentation.default_screen_ratio` (`monitor` / `game`); validation runs keep the PS2 default. **Note:** this presets a game option (category 2 by User request: the result is the game's own 16:9 mode, as if the player had chosen it) | `../port/port-features.md` §2 | 2026-10-20 (User request: "detect the aspect ratio of the monitor it was started on") |
| Modern control types | CONTROLLER SETUP's CONTROL TYPE offers NORMAL (MODERN), EASY (MODERN), NORMAL (CLASSIC), EASY (CLASSIC); the Classic ones are the game's NORMAL and EASY, the Modern ones the same types with L1 / L2 and R1 / R2 swapped by the port's input layer (live devices only). The save data keeps the Classic type; the Modern flag per player is a port setting (`input.modern_controls`), default on for both players, so the default is NORMAL (MODERN) (the game's own default type is NORMAL) | `../port/port-features.md` §4 | 2026-10-20 |
| Input rebinding | keyboard and host controllers (SDL3) mapped onto the exact PS2 pad bytes; bindings in `settings.json`; the game's `ConvertPadInput` is unchanged | ADR-005 | 2026-10-11 |
| Audio on focus loss | setting `audio.on_focus_loss`: `keep_playing` (default) or `mute`; never pauses the simulation | ADR-005 | 2026-10-11 |
| Higher internal rendering resolution | factor 1–8 (`presentation.internal_scale`, default 1; `--internal-scale`); frame-sized buffers render at N×, the small shadow/glow targets stay 1×, 2D sprites keep their native texel grid, movies are drawn from the upscaling stage at N > 1; the output pass scales from N × the native size. Guest RAM identical at every factor (`../port/validation.md` IR-1) | `../port/renderer.md` §1, ADR-006 | 2026-10-19 (User request: test up to 8×) |
| Movie upscaling | decoded movie pictures (640×448; 640×336 for SS01–SS12) pass a separate, replaceable upscaling stage before the output pass, scaled by the internal-resolution factor (passthrough at 1× until higher internal resolutions are enabled); AMD FidelityFX FSR 1 EASU, plus RCAS sharpening if it improves the result; each picture is still held for exactly 2 game ticks; game code and guest RAM unchanged | ADR-006 §5 | 2026-10-13 |

Interpolation is feasible with the node matrices and the camera recorded per step (ADR-002 research findings). Effects and particles use their pool slot as identity and must snap when a slot is reused.

## Pending (User's decision)

None.

## Later

| Candidate | Reasoning | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Audio output device selection and latency setting | the port uses the system default device until then (User 2026-10-11) | none |
| MSAA, anisotropic filtering, area downsample in the output pass | image quality | feasibility study 2026-10-20: `../port/renderer.md` §1.8 (recommended next: the area downsample; MSAA and anisotropic filtering not recommended now). FXAA / SMAA: built (Approved) |

## Modding layer only (category 3)

| Feature | Why not baseline |
|---|---|
| Widescreen (Hor+) | changes the projection and HUD layout, possibly culling and what the player sees. Not checked yet: whether any gameplay rule uses on-screen visibility (e.g. lock-on through the camera projection). Draw-phase randomness (sky, sun jitter) must run identically either way |
| Effects detail / "reduce effects" | effects read the random table inside the simulation step, so changing them changes gameplay randomness; must be labelled gameplay-altering (`../subsystems/effects.md`) |
| VS LAN play (ADR-008, option A, approved 2026-10-13) | not intrinsic to a PC port and adds input delay; lockstep input sharing over UDP on the local network, opt-in per session, original local split screen unchanged as the default; optional crop to the local player's view |
| Debug overlay and its tools | optional debug layer (`../port/port-features.md` §8); opens only when `debug.overlay_enabled` is true (default off; on by default in development builds); nothing changes unless it is opened |
| Frame-rate overlay | debug layer (User request 2026-10-20): FPS and frame time at the top right, `--fps-overlay` / `debug.fps_overlay` / the debug overlay's checkbox, off by default (`../port/port-features.md` §7) |

## Not features (follow from other decisions)

| Item | Note |
|---|---|
| Memory card mapping onto `saves\` | PCSX2 interoperability (ADR-005); port 2 reports empty |
| On-screen messages from the port (ISO check failure, save path) outside game rendering | needed for errors |
