# Documentation index

Reference documentation for the Ace Combat 04 (SLUS_201.52) PC port. Project rules: `../CLAUDE.md`. Short status: `STATUS.md`.

Where to start:
- **Running or configuring the port:** `port/port-features.md` (settings, defaults, menus, overlays) and `port/command-line.md` (every parameter, development builds included, with recipes).
- **Translating game code:** `port/slices.md` (plan and results per slice), the subsystem notes under `subsystems/`, `game/` and `formats/`, and the `port-function` skill.
- **Checking against PCSX2:** `port/validation-strategy.md` (method), `port/validation.md` (every run), `pcsx2/procedures.md` (what the User still has to capture).

Reorganised 2026-10-20 (no content removed): the PCSX2 session files were merged into `pcsx2/sessions.md`, `port/pcsx2-pending.md` into `pcsx2/procedures.md`, `formats/SM-model.md` into `formats/MODEL.md`; the slice reports moved from `STATUS.md` to `port/slices.md` and the skeleton milestones to `port/skeleton-readiness.md`; the `settings.json` keys moved from `port/command-line.md` to `port/port-features.md`.

Reorganised again 2026-10-22 (no content removed; merged documents keep their sections, numbered ones with a prefix): `game/scenes.md` and `game/main-context.md` into `game/boot.md`; `subsystems/iop-sound.md` into `subsystems/sound.md`; `subsystems/mission-load.md` into `subsystems/mission-flow.md`; `platform/supported-version.md`, `platform/elf-sections.md` and `platform/toolchain.md` into `platform/executable.md`; `port/debug-overlay.md` into `port/port-features.md` (§8, its §4.1 = §8.4.1); `port/internal-resolution.md` and `port/gpu-work.md` into `port/renderer.md` (§1.x and §2.x); `port/s4-inventory.md` and `port/s5-plan.md` into `port/slices.md` (appendices A and B, §A.x and §B.x). References in the repo were updated; `rename-log.csv` and the Ghidra comments it records keep the old names.
