# Open research questions

Questions that are still open. Checks that need PCSX2 have their steps in `pcsx2/procedures.md` (numbers in brackets). Answered questions are at the end with a pointer to the doc that holds the answer.

## Need PCSX2

| Question | Doc | Procedure |
|---|---|---|
| Movie upscaling: does FSR 1 RCAS sharpening improve the EASU output on the real movies (ADR-006 §5 point 3)? Compare `--movie-upscale 2` screenshots with and without RCAS | `decisions/ADR-006-presentation-resolution.md` | owner, visual (no PCSX2) |
| libmpeg `sceMpeg.frameCount` and `flags`: PCSX2 shows 46 where the port counts 47 pictures returned in the chunk, and flags 0x19B where the port writes 0. The game reads neither (expected `sdk` differences). One more data point would fix the counting rule (a state mid-chunk at a known picture) | `src/sce/libmpeg.cpp`, `port/validation.md` S3-3 | low priority, no procedure |
| VU0 micro skinning test vectors for part types 0 and 3 (type 1 captured, `pcsx2/sessions-05.md`; feeds STATUS decision 14) | `subsystems/vu-programs.md` | [1] |
| Folder memory card: format against PCSX2 v2.8.2, round trip of a save, file times | `formats/folder-memcard.md` | needs the port's `sceMc*` layer first |
| I/O latency: PCSX2 reaches scene 6 sub 7 one frame later with an unformatted card than with no card, and its DATA 333 load takes ~17 frames (port: 3); the title data DATA 0xB0 takes about 20 frames longer than in the port (S2a: the menu fade at title sub 6 is 20 frames further on, `port/validation.md` S2a-3). A latency model for CD reads and libmc that matches PCSX2 frame for frame needs more cold-boot runs; until then frame counters are `timing` differences at checkpoints | `port/validation.md` S1-1, S2a-3, `port/ramdiff-expected-s1.csv`, `-s2a.csv` | before the input-recording slices (S5c) |
| VAG.IRX timing: the port runs `VagMain` from the mixer's SPU2 IRQ, so its phase against the game step (and the ring index / played bytes in each reply) can differ from PCSX2 by one half-buffer period (10 ms); not separable at the S2a checkpoints, because the stream positions there also differ by music time (Start pressed at another moment); recheck from a recording with an input-aligned checkpoint | `subsystems/iop-sound.md` VAG.IRX, `port/validation.md` S2a-3 | first input-recording slice |
| Menu frame filter (zoom blur) in the port differs from PCSX2 in a radial pattern: centre G/B −1.5/−2.8, edges and corners +1 to +3. PCSX2's software and hardware renderers agree (within 0.3), so the port is the outlier. Bilinear rounding tests shift the level but keep the shape, so it is not only blend rounding. Next: compare the alpha channel (Ad of the zoom blur) and the glow texture 0x3E90 in GS local memory with the save state's `GS.bin` (needs a port GS-memory dump; ask the owner before a programmable-blend redesign) | `port/validation.md` S2a-4 | run 08 |
| Port determinism under host load: five port instances run in parallel reached the S4 title checkpoint with different SMV chunk buffers (1-1.5 MB of movie data at other positions) than a single run, so the movie stream's progress depends on host timing (presumably the mixer/audio thread draining the SMV PCM in real time). Game logic was unaffected at the checkpoint; it matters for lockstep LAN play (ADR-008) and for recording replays. Find where host time enters. Checked 2026-10-16 (`port/s5-plan.md` P1): the SPU model already runs per step; 1 solo + 4 parallel runs to the title card were identical except the pad analog bytes (live device overlaid on the pad script, sampled per presented frame); the movie-buffer case did not reproduce. Also seen in the hangar performance work: a run that took a screenshot every 60 vblanks at 6 fps reached the hangar with the camera at another orbit phase than runs without (`port/validation.md` S4-6) | `port/validation.md` S4-1, `subsystems/iop-sound.md` | before the input-recording slices (S5c) |
| Owner check from slice S1: controller input in the port after the start-up enumeration fix (the session log now lists the devices SDL sees) | `port/validation.md` S1-2 | owner, any time |

## Static analysis (Ghidra, tools)

- **Formats:** VPK container layout; Namco sound-bank header format (DATA 0x164/0x165) and its pairing with BD.CDP bodies; terrain blocks (MISSION 5–18, 31), unit placement records (22) and message system (34/35); what the shared mission packets 0 and 26 draw; VIF vertex layout inside model node packets; model animation key format and vertex-animation block; AIRCRAFT block 6 fields and which item of block 2 is the cockpit.
- **SMV audio:** the exact sample layout of the 0x4000-byte PCM blocks (H: SPU2 core-0 input, L/R alternating in 0x200-byte blocks; `subsystems/iop-sound.md`). Can be checked offline on the audio blocks of one SMV file.
- **Weapons:** weapon id → in-game weapon name (special-weapon tables in AIRCRAFT data); whether any aircraft carries special-weapon id 15.
- **AI:** identity of the class 8/9 cannons (H: Stonehenge) and of the class 10 scripted objects (type 0x4C objects react to the strike event zones).
- **Rendering:** what each VU1 program computes; whether the first pool table of the flight frame receives packets from outside `BuildFlightDrawLists`.
- **Effects:** names of the effect types marked (H).
- **Sound and radio:** mapping of radio event ids to the probability table 0x00409DA8; SOUND `delay_timer` / `spu_register_timer`; the writer of VAG reply words +0x50/+0x60 (0x200 measured).
- **VS mode:** which `ShowCenterMessage` ids (0x11–0x13) are win / lose / draw; which stage-data field sets the split-screen flag through `game+0x20`; whether any VS stage spawns AI units (`subsystems/vs-mode.md` §7, VS slice).
- **Input recordings:** frame offset between a PCSX2 `.p2m2` record and the step whose `scePadRead` returns it (PS2 pad latency; calibrated in the first gameplay slice, `port/validation-strategy.md` §3.2).
- **Flight:** meaning of the constants at 0x0040DF68–0x0040DFBC.
- **Main context:** `unk_310` (0x310–0xA0F) and the pad sub-structs; whether the struct really ends at 0xA20; result record +0x0E (u16 unit count at creation vs. byte "players" in the results code).
- **Memory:** game code that relies on `lq`/`sq` ignoring the low 4 address bits; absolute addresses inside the remaining packet sub-blocks.
- **Executable:** contents of `.data`; whether the 34 unreferenced `bad_alloc` strings mark g++ translation units (module boundaries, `platform/toolchain.md`); a full list of the libgcc double-precision call sites (13–15 per routine; known: flight damping, `func_00137930`, `func_00215D20`, `func_00216D88`, `func_00224848`, `func_001FD398`; `port/coverage.md`).
- **SDK names still hypothesis:** libmpeg `sceMpegSetImageBuff` 0x00270B58 is called as `(mp, bitstream, size)` (AddBs-like) and 0x00270CA8 is polled as "bitstream consumed", so both names need rechecking; libkernl internals `_InitSys`, `scePrintf`, `sceFsInit`, `sceFsReset`, `_lf_bind`, `_SifLoadModule`, `sceSifExitRpc`; libpkt variant (Vif1/Gif/Vif0) of the 5 functions at 0x00262E08–0x00262E98; syscall numbers 0xFD/−0xFE of two uncalled alarm stubs (ps2sdk numbers differ).
- **IRX:** import the `.mdebug` STABS info of the IRX modules (needs `stdump`); re-import the other 7 IRX as R3000 if needed.
- **Ghidra:** rename the `MainContext` and `CdFileEntry` fields to snake_case by hand (the ghidra-mcp plugin re-adds type prefixes, `decisions/naming-convention.md`).

## Answered

| Question | Answer | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| Effect trail `func_001F3D38` glow-alpha division trap | no trap in practice: the divisor is span x (span x 4) (stack words 0x78 / 0xD8, re-read while translating the dead copy 0x001F5280), not span x 2 - n; span is 6 for every kind, so it is never 0. The earlier translation divided by span x 2 - n and was corrected (S8, 2026-10-19) | `src/game/effect_draw.cpp` |
| SOUND id-6 reply (0x00410D08, SPU limit for bank registration) | min(ESA0, ESA1) read after the command with libsd's work-area table; core 1 mode 2 = 0x001FE0C0, so the reply is core 0's 0x001DFFF0 (PCSX2 SPU2 state; the old 0x001DB7C0 was core 0 in mode 3), 2026-10-16 | `port/validation.md` S4-7 |
| VAG.IRX mode 4 vs. mode 8, `VagMain` ring hand-off, fno 1 command fields | command 1 (mode 4) streams while the EE keeps reading; command 2 (mode 8) = all data already read, the channel ends (0x40) or chains (0x80); a ring segment is handed back when 0x10000 bytes per voice are played; command fields {id, slot, bytes per voice, voice count, frequency word} (S2a, 2026-10-14) | `subsystems/iop-sound.md` VAG.IRX |

| EE `add.s`/`sub.s` in PCSX2 | not plain round-to-nearest: PCSX2's `FPU_ADD_SUB` (always on) masks the smaller operand to 25 − d significand bits before the SSE add; `fpu::Add`/`Sub` model it and all translated float adds use them (S2a, 2026-10-14) | `port/validation.md` S2a-3 |
