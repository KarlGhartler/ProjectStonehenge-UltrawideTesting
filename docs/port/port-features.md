# Port features (as built)

What the port adds on top of the original game, how it is built and where it is configured. The list of approved features and their approval dates is `../decisions/port-baseline.md`; command-line parameters are in `command-line.md`. Nothing here changes game logic: guest RAM and the save data hold what the PS2 holds (checked by the regression suite, `validation.md` §2l and §2m). The one deliberate exception is the SCREEN RATIO default on a wide monitor (§2, User request 2026-10-20): it presets a game option before any save data is read, as if the player had chosen 16:9.

The debug overlay (formerly `debug-overlay.md`, "Proposal: debug overlay") is section 8; its sections keep their numbers with the prefix 8. (`debug-overlay.md` §4.1 is §8.4.1 here).

## 1. Settings

### Where settings live

| Data | Place | User |
|---|---|---|
| Port settings (presentation, input bindings, Modern control types, audio, paths, debug) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AC04Port\settings.json` (or `--user-data`) | the port (`src/platform/settings.*`) |
| The game's own options: brightness, screen ratio, screen position, captions, HUD unit, interlude, both players' control type, reverse, vibration and pilot view | the game's save data on the memory card (`saves\`, the campaign block 0x002A0318, 0x12C0 bytes, which includes the option bytes 0x002A15CC and the controller words 0x002A15D0), written by the game's SAVE page | the game |

A new memory card at first start: when the saves folder holds no card, the port creates a formatted 8 MB PCSX2 folder card there at once (`_pcsx2_superblock`, `../formats/folder-memcard.md` §9), so PCSX2 sees a formatted card even before the first save; the game itself creates its save file on the first SAVE ("No AC04 files found on memory card. Create save file?"). Checked 2026-10-20 (`validation.md` §2o): New Game, campaign menu, SAVE, File 1, then LOAD and CONTINUE in a new session; the files and the `_pcsx2_index` are those of a PCSX2-made save.

Checked end to end 2026-10-20 (`validation.md` §2m, ST-3): CONTROLLER SETUP changed to NORMAL (CLASSIC) with REVERSE on and saved through the campaign menu's SAVE page: `settings.json` got `modern_controls: [false, true]`, the card file changed in exactly two places (player 1's controller word 0x0008 → 0x000A and the checksum), and a new session that loads the card shows NORMAL (CLASSIC), REVERSE ON.

### `settings.json` rules (User decision 2026-10-20)

- Missing keys take their default; a missing file is written with the defaults at start. The defaults depend on the display the port starts on (below), so a missing key takes the default **for this display**.
- A file that cannot be read, is not valid JSON, has another `version` (current: 1), an unknown key or an invalid value is **rejected as a whole**: the port logs what was wrong, deletes the file and writes the defaults in its place. This also applies when the file is changed on disk while the port runs (it is re-read once per second; every change applies at once).
- The file holds only known keys. It is written when a menu page saves (GRAPHICS: ACCEPT; CONTROLLER SETUP: ACCEPT) and at exit for the windowed size; always the file values, so session-only command-line overrides are never saved.
- Adding a key: give it a default in `src/platform/settings.h`, read and write it in `settings.cpp` (with `Reader`), add it to the change notification (`SettingsStore::Replace`), test it in `tests/test_settings.cpp`, and list it below. A key added this way keeps older files valid (missing = default). Removing or renaming a key, or changing the meaning of a value, needs a `version` bump, which rejects older files (the User's rule above).

### Defaults on the start display (User request 2026-10-20)

The port reads the desktop mode of the primary display (where the window opens) at start (`DisplayInfo`, logged as `display: WxH, N Hz`). `DefaultSettings(display)`:
- **Fullscreen** (borderless, the size of the desktop).
- **V-sync on** (since 2026-10-22, User request; before: only at 60 or 120 Hz). With a refresh rate other than 60 or 120 Hz the frame cap, which applies when v-sync is turned off, is the highest one at or below it (144 Hz → 144, 165 Hz → 144, 240 Hz → 240, 75 Hz → 60
- **FXAA** and the **internal resolution closest to the display** (since 2026-10-22, User request): N with 448 × N lines closest to the display height, 1–8 (720p and 1080p 2×, 1440p 3×, 4K 5×, unknown 1×; `DefaultInternalScale`). Validation runs (development builds: pad script, input log, PCSX2 recording, `--memcard`, `--no-memcard`) keep 1× and no anti-aliasing so their screenshots compare with the baselines; the startup log names the default scale.
- These are the defaults of a first start (no `settings.json` yet), of a rejected file replaced with the defaults and of a file's missing keys; an existing `settings.json` keeps its values. The saves do not influence them).
- Everything else as in the key table.

The GRAPHICS page's DEFAULT button sets these values too.

### `settings.json` keys

| Key | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | `1` | `1` |
| `presentation.filter` | `sharp`, `smooth` | `sharp` |
| `presentation.vsync` | `true`, `false` | `true` |
| `presentation.frame_cap` | `60`, `120`, `144`, `240`, `360`; used only with v-sync off (with v-sync on the display paces the frames) | `360`, or the refresh-rate cap (above) |
| `presentation.window_mode` | `windowed`, `fullscreen` (borderless desktop-size window; `borderless`, the earlier name, is read as `fullscreen`) | `fullscreen` |
| `presentation.window_width` / `window_height` | windowed client size (saved at exit) | `1280` / `960` |
| `presentation.internal_scale` | `1`–`8` (internal rendering resolution; changes apply while running) | closest to the display (above); `1` in validation runs |
| `presentation.frame_interpolation` | `true`, `false`: above 60 presented frames per second the 3D is drawn between the last two game steps (§2) | `true` |
| `presentation.antialiasing` | `off`, `fxaa`, `smaa`: anti-aliasing of the flight views before their HUD (§2); `--antialiasing` for a session | `fxaa`; `off` in validation runs |
| `presentation.default_screen_ratio` | `monitor` (the game's SCREEN RATIO starts at 16:9 on a monitor wider than 4:3, §2), `game` (the PS2 default, 4:3) | `monitor` |
| `paths.iso` | disc image path | empty |
| `audio.on_focus_loss` | `keep_playing`, `mute` | `keep_playing` |
| `input.bindings.<control>` | list of `key:<SDL key name>`, `pad:<button>`, `axis:<axis>+` / `axis:<axis>-` | see `DefaultInputSettings()` |
| `input.modern_controls` | `[player 1, player 2]`, `true` / `false`: the Modern variant of the game's CONTROL TYPE (L1 / L2 and R1 / R2 swapped; set on CONTROLLER SETUP, §4) | `[true, true]` |
| `debug.overlay_enabled` | `true`, `false` | `true` in development builds, `false` in release |
| `debug.overlay_toggle` | a typed character, or `key:<SDL key name>` | `\` |
| `debug.fps_overlay` | `true`, `false`: the frame-rate overlay (§7) | `false` |

PS2 controls: `cross circle square triangle l1 r1 l2 r2 l3 r3 start select up down left right lx- lx+ ly- ly+ rx- rx+ ry- ry+`.
Gamepad buttons: `south east west north back guide start leftstick rightstick leftshoulder rightshoulder dpup dpdown dpleft dpright` (positions, not vendor labels). Gamepad axes: `leftx lefty rightx righty lefttrigger righttrigger`. Port 1 uses the keyboard and the first gamepad, port 2 the second gamepad.

Vibration (2026-10-22, User request): the values the game sends with `scePadSetActDirect` (mapped by its `scePadSetActAlign` table: the DualShock 2's small motor on/off, the large motor 0–255) go to the gamepad of that port as SDL rumble (large motor = low-frequency rumble, small = high-frequency at full strength), sent when they change and refreshed every 500 ms while running. The game's VIBRATION option (CONTROLLER SETUP, save data) switches it, as on the PS2; no `settings.json` key. Runs fed from `--pad-script` or a recording keep the pads still. The guest rumble state is untouched (`risks.md`, rumble row). Code: `src/sce/libpad.cpp`, `InputBackend::SetVibration`.

## 2. Presentation

| Feature | Built as | Setting |
|---|---|---|
| Output scaling | the native (or N×) image is scaled to the window, 4:3 pillarboxed or 16:9 while the game's SCREEN RATIO option is on (main context flag 0x10000); filters sharp / smooth | `presentation.filter` |
| Window | windowed (size remembered) or fullscreen (a borderless window the size of the desktop) | `presentation.window_mode` |
| V-sync, frame cap | presentation timing only; the simulation steps at 59.94 Hz (ADR-002). V-sync on = FIFO present mode and no frame cap; off = MAILBOX (or IMMEDIATE) and the cap | `presentation.vsync`, `presentation.frame_cap` |
| Internal resolution 1–8× | frame-sized targets at N×, small shadow/glow targets at 1×, 2D sprites on their native texel grid, sprite edges on native pixel borders (`renderer.md` §1.7) | `presentation.internal_scale`, `--internal-scale` |
| Movie upscaling | FSR 1 EASU at the internal-resolution factor (ADR-006 §5) | follows the internal resolution; `--movie-upscale` |
| Anti-aliasing (2026-10-20) | FXAA 3.11 (one pass, quality preset 29, luma from green) or SMAA 1x (three passes, preset HIGH, luma edges) over each flight view's rectangle of the frame buffer, **after the view's 3D and before its HUD**, so HUD lines, text, radio window, menus and the screen fade stay sharp (User request). How the point is found: `BuildFlightDrawLists` records the first DMA tag of each view's 2D overlay table (`port::Render()`, host state only); the DMA walker marks the GIF data where it reaches that tag (`SourceMark::kAntiAlias`); `GsState` puts an `aa_point` entry into the draw list there; the backend copies the target, runs the passes with the view's rectangle as scissor and copies the rectangle back (`src/platform/render/gs/gs_antialias.cpp`). RGB only: the frame buffer's alpha (GS alpha, read by later draws) is kept. Works at every internal scale (it runs on the scaled target). Only scene 2 (flight, in-engine cutscenes) has the point; menus with 3D (hangar, aircraft viewer) are not anti-aliased. **The SMV movies (INTRO, SS01–SS12, STAFF, the MIS briefing movies) are never anti-aliased** (User rule 2026-10-20): they get only the FSR 1 upscaling stage; checked with SS01 at 1× and 2×, SMAA on and off give identical frames (`validation.md` §2n AA-4). Third-party code: `../decisions/dependencies.md` | `presentation.antialiasing`, `--antialiasing` |
| Frame interpolation (2026-10-22) | above 60 presented frames per second (a 120/144 Hz display with v-sync, or v-sync off with a higher cap), each frame shows the 3D world between the last two game steps: the VU1 program runs of the newest step are repeated with their matrices blended (ADR-002; `validation.md` §2ac). The HUD, 2D, effects the EE projects itself and movies show the newest step. A frame that has to catch up more than one step is shown unblended. Off in validation runs (unless `--frame-interpolation on`) and while fast-forwarding; at 60 Hz nothing changes. Cost (2026-10-23, `validation.md` §2ad): mission 1 at 8× with SMAA on a 4K display, v-sync off, cap 360: 99 fps, 0 ticks dropped; the hangar 80 fps | `presentation.frame_interpolation` (file only), `--frame-interpolation` |
| SCREEN RATIO default | on a monitor wider than 4:3 (aspect above 4:3 by more than 2.5 %: 16:9, 16:10, 21:9) the game's SCREEN RATIO option starts at 16:9: the port sets bit 0 of the option byte 0x002A15CC right after `InitOptionData` at boot (`src/game/boot.cpp`, `port::Boot()`), before `ApplyOptionSettings`. Save data loaded later replaces the byte, so a player's saved choice wins; with no save the game shows its own 16:9 mode (anamorphic, all of the game's 16:9 layouts). Validation runs keep the PS2 default (4:3): any pad script, input log, PCSX2 recording, `--memcard` or `--no-memcard` (logged as `SCREEN RATIO default: 4:3 (validation run: PS2 default)`) | `presentation.default_screen_ratio` |

All of them can be changed while the port runs (GRAPHICS page or `settings.json`), and every change applies at once. Checked 2026-10-20 (`validation.md` §2m, ST-1 and ST-2): eight combinations of window mode, v-sync, cap, scale and filter switched during mission 4 gameplay at normal speed. A change of the internal scale rebuilds the render targets: at 6× and 8× this costs one hitch of 0.3–0.6 s (the simulation drops those ticks, as after any host stall); the other settings switch within a frame.

## 3. GRAPHICS page

The last item of OPTIONS → SCREEN SETTINGS, after HUD UNIT (and after INTERLUDE once that is unlocked). Code: `src/game/graphics_page.*`, hooks marked `port:` in `src/game/options_page.cpp`.

- Opens like SCREEN POSITION and BRIGHTNESS (state 6 → view 3 of the options page) and uses the BRIGHTNESS view's widgets: its outer frames, a typed title "GRAPHICS >", the choice-square glyph, the pulsing box on the chosen square, the crosshair and the help box.
- Rows (name, chosen value, squares): FULLSCREEN ON / OFF, V-SYNC ON / OFF, FRAME RATE CAP 60–360 FPS, INTERNAL RES. 1X–8X, SCALING FILTER SHARP / SMOOTH, ANTI-ALIASING OFF / FXAA / SMAA (2026-10-20; the panel is one row taller).
- With V-SYNC ON the frame rate cap does not apply: its row shows "V-SYNC" instead of a value, has no squares and the cursor skips it (User request 2026-10-20).
- Up/down choose the row, left/right the value (clamped, the < > arrows dim at the ends). **Every change applies at once** (User request 2026-10-20): the page hands each new value to the host, which applies it without saving. ACCEPT (× or ○) saves the values to `settings.json`; CANCEL (△) restores the values the page opened with; □ sets the defaults for this display (§1) and applies them. The help box shows the options page's own messages 1 and 3 ("Use Left Analog Stick to adjust", "×: ACCEPT / △: CANCEL / □: DEFAULT").
- The game's menu tables are not changed: the column-0 definition gets the GRAPHICS item only while the tree is built or its cursors are stored (`GraphicsItemPatch`), and the item ids the page reports are mapped back to the game's (`OptionsSelection`).
- The page reads and writes the settings through `src/common/port_hooks.h` (copied before each tick, applied by the host after it): game code never reads settings.

## 4. Modern control types

CONTROLLER SETUP's CONTROL TYPE row has four squares: NORMAL (MODERN), EASY (MODERN), NORMAL (CLASSIC), EASY (CLASSIC). The two Classic squares are the original ones, at their original places; the Modern ones are to their left.

- Classic = the game's NORMAL and EASY. Modern = the same type with **L1 ↔ L2 and R1 ↔ R2** (buttons and pressures) swapped by the port before the game reads the pad (`platform::SwapShoulderButtons`, applied in `TickInputFeed::Latch` to live devices only: pad scripts, input logs and PCSX2 recordings already hold what the game reads, and input logs record the swapped state).
- The save data keeps the Classic type: moving over the four squares changes the game's type bit exactly as the original two squares do, so guest RAM and the memory card hold only values the original can hold. The Modern flag is a port setting per player (`input.modern_controls`), handed to the host on ACCEPT and re-applied at every start.
- Applied on ACCEPT, not at once: the page is the game's own, which keeps every change in a copy until ACCEPT (original behaviour), and the Modern flag belongs to the same CONTROL TYPE choice.
- Default: Modern on for both players. The game's own default type is NORMAL (controller word 8 from `func_00105728`), so the port's default is NORMAL (MODERN) for players 1 and 2 without touching game data.
- With Modern on, the page's button table shows the swapped rows (L1 YAW LEFT, L2 THROTTLE DOWN, R1 YAW RIGHT, R2 THROTTLE UP; with EASY the yaw rows show "------", which are then L1 / R1 instead of L2 / R2).
- Code: `src/game/controller_page.cpp` (lines marked "port:"), `src/platform/input_log.*`, `src/main.cpp`.

## 5. Port-owned guest memory

The game draws menu texts and items from guest addresses, so the strings and tables of §3 and §4 live in a port-owned area above the initial guest stack pointer, **0x01FFF800–0x01FFFFFF** (`src/game/port_menu.h`, 32 slots of 64 bytes). The game never reads or writes it (the stack starts at 0x01FFED60 and grows down); it is written only while CONTROLLER SETUP, the options page or the main menu (§9, slots 20-21) is open, or a page's texts are loaded (§10, slots 22-31). RAM checkpoints taken on those pages show it as a port-only range.

## 6. Renderer caches (performance, no visible change)

| Cache | Key | Bound |
|---|---|---|
| Decoded textures (`GsState::DecodeTexture`, 2026-10-22) | texture registers, palette with TEXA and the mip registers, texel range; one entry per key, valid while every 256-byte GS block it read keeps its generation (no content hash any more, `renderer.md` §2) | 4096 entries and 256 MiB of texture images (`GsState::kTextureCacheBytes`); emptied when either is reached. A texture whose memory changed is decoded again and replaces its entry; the CPU decoder (`--cpu-texture-decode`) redoes only the changed blocks when at most half changed |
| Texture images (`GsBackend::TexImage`, 2026-10-22, replaces the atlas) | `DecodedTexture::serial` (one per decode) | one RGBA8 image per decoded texture (size rounded up to 32), kept while the decoded-texture cache or a draw holds the texture; then it waits in a free pool (128 MiB) and is reused for a texture of the same size once the frames in flight are done. Decoded on the GPU from the GPU copy of GS local memory (`gs_decode.comp`); with `--cpu-texture-decode` uploaded whole |
| GPU copy of GS local memory (`GsBackend::gs_memory_`, 2026-10-22) | — | 4 MiB, device local. Only the 256-byte blocks written since the last update are copied, just before the first decode that reads one of them (`TextureOp`) |
| Per-frame lists of the Vulkan backend (texture work, uploads, vertices) | reused from frame to frame | grow to the largest frame |

Before 2026-10-20 the decoded-texture cache had only the entry bound: with the terrain atlas rebuilt every frame it held up to about 6 GB before emptying. Until the residency (also 2026-10-20) every texture a frame drew was copied to the GPU again each frame: about 3 MB per frame in the mission 1 opening, 108 KiB in mission 4; now 18 KiB and 1 KiB (`validation.md` §2m, ST-4). Until 2026-10-22 decoded textures were packed into one atlas, which restarted when a frame's new textures did not fit: in mission 4 combat about every 12 game ticks, with 5.3 MiB uploaded per frame (`renderer.md` §2.5). The renderer logs its average cost per frame at exit (`renderer: N frames drawn; per frame on average: GS processing … ms, recording … ms, … textures drawn, … decoded on the GPU, … uploaded from the CPU, … GPU memory updates, … KiB uploaded`) and shows the last frame's values in the debug overlay's Performance panel.

## 7. Frame-rate overlay (debug layer)

Presented frames per second and the mean frame time over the last half second, two lines of small white text with a one-pixel shadow at the top right of the window (no window frame or background, so it hides as little of the picture as possible; in fullscreen 4:3 it sits in the pillarbox). Drawn by the debug overlay's ImGui context after the output pass, so it never enters the game image, screenshots or the guest. On with `--fps-overlay` (session), `debug.fps_overlay` (saved) or the "FPS overlay" checkbox in the debug overlay's Performance panel (session); works in release builds too, where it creates only the overlay context, not the debug panels. Code: `src/platform/debug/overlay.cpp` (`DrawFps`).

## 8. Debug overlay (proposal and implementation)

Status: **first version implemented (skeleton milestone D, 2026-10-12)**, see §8.7. The rest of this section is the approved proposal. Part of the optional debug layer (CLAUDE.md, category 3). Nothing changes in the default experience unless the overlay is opened, and features that can change simulation results are marked.

### 8.1 Opening and closing

- **Toggle key: `\`**, matched by the **typed character**, not the physical key: the overlay listens to SDL3 text input (`SDL_EVENT_TEXT_INPUT`) and toggles when the text is `"\"`. This works on any layout: on an Italian keyboard `\` is the key left of `1`; on US/UK it is next to Enter/Shift.
  - Layouts that produce `\` only with AltGr still work, because the produced character is what counts.
  - Text input must stay enabled while the game runs; the game itself reads only pad state, so this has no side effect.
- **Rebindable** in `settings.json`: `"debug": {"overlay_toggle": "\\"}` (a character) or a key name (`"F12"`) for players who prefer a scancode.
- While the overlay has keyboard focus, keys are **not** forwarded to the game's pad mapping (no accidental inputs). Gamepad input still goes to the game unless "capture pad" is ticked.

**Proposal: also require a settings flag.** `"debug": {"overlay_enabled": false}` by default. With it off, `\` does nothing and the overlay code is never initialised (no ImGui context, no GPU resources). Reasons: a stray `\` (e.g. while typing a pilot name in the game's own name entry, which uses the pad, or alt-tabbing) cannot open it; players who never touch the debug layer get exactly the default experience; support logs record whether it was enabled. The flag is also settable by a command-line switch (`--debug-overlay`) for development.

### 8.2 Look

- **Square UI, no rounded corners anywhere.** Dear ImGui style: `WindowRounding`, `ChildRounding`, `FrameRounding`, `PopupRounding`, `ScrollbarRounding`, `GrabRounding`, `TabRounding` all **0**; also `WindowBorderSize = 1`, no anti-aliased rounded fill. Applied once at context creation.
- Drawn by the **output pass, after the 4:3 game image** (ADR-006), directly into the swapchain image at host resolution. It never draws into guest render targets, so GS state, framebuffer contents and any GS-dump comparison are unaffected.
- Semi-transparent panels over the game; a "game in a window" mode that shrinks the 4:3 image into a panel is a later option.

### 8.3 Dependency

| | |
|---|---|
| Library | **Dear ImGui** (Omar Cornut and contributors) |
| License | **MIT**: compatible with GPL-3.0 (`../decisions/dependencies.md`) |
| Backends | `imgui_impl_sdl3` + `imgui_impl_vulkan`, both in the upstream repo, so no third-party glue |
| Integration | FetchContent pinned to a release tag with checksum, unmodified (no `third_party/` copy). Memory editor widget: write our own (the popular `imgui_club` memory editor is MIT too, but ours must show PS2 addresses and symbol names anyway) |
| Build | always compiled (one binary), initialised only when `overlay_enabled` is true |

Alternatives: Nuklear (MIT, no maintained Vulkan backend, fewer widgets), RmlUi (MIT, HTML/CSS, aimed at game UI, heavy). Recommendation: **Dear ImGui**. Added to `../decisions/dependencies.md` as proposed.

### 8.4 Features

Effort: S ≤ 2 days, M 3–6 days, L > 1 week (each assumes the subsystem it reads already exists). "Sim" = can it change simulation results: **no** (read-only, cannot), **guarded** (changes only presentation or is safe by construction, rules given), **yes** (changes game state on purpose; such actions mark the session as "modified" in the log and in the overlay title bar).

#### 8.4.1 Read-only

| Feature | What it shows | Source | Effort | Sim |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Performance and frame timing | presented FPS, simulation steps per presented frame, catch-up count and dropped time (ADR-002 accumulator), CPU time per phase (game step, draw-list build, renderer, present), GPU time per bucket | platform timers, Vulkan timestamp queries | S | no |
| Scene inspector | current scene / sub-state (`ctx` scene fields, scene-2 sub-state 0x0029F38E), frame counters (`frame_count`, `frame_count_unpaused`, `scene_frame`), mission id (`game[0x27]`), `RequestScene`/`RequestSubState` log with frame numbers | guest memory + a hook in the translated `RequestScene`/`RequestSubState` | S | no |
| Memory viewer | hex/float/u16/u32 view at PS2 addresses (RAM, scratchpad), labels from `docs/symbols.csv` loaded at start, go-to by name | `GuestMemory` | M | no |
| Watch list | user-chosen globals and `g_MainContext` fields (typed from the struct definitions shared with `static_assert`s), change highlighting | guest memory + struct metadata | M | no |
| Work heap meter | used / free of the game bump allocator (0x00101000) and the work heap (98.4 % used in mission 1, `../game/memory.md`), high-water mark, allocation list by caller address | allocator hook | S | no |
| Random sources | the five sources (`../game/random.md`): table cursor and reads this frame (with caller address), libc `rand` state and call count, VU0 R, effect LCG words, sound LFSR | guest memory + counters in the translated helpers | S | no |
| File / CD queue | pending CD requests (ticket, DATA/BD index, sector, size, age vs. the 3600-frame timeout), ISO read throughput | `sceCd*` shim | S | no |
| Sound | SOUND.IRX voices (state, ADSR phase, pitch, volume), VAG slots 0–5 (stream position, buffer fill), RPC log (command batches, replies) | audio backend (ADR-004) | M | no |
| Input viewer | host input → PS2 pad bytes (`scePadRead` buffer), analog/pressure values, `ConvertPadInput` result | input backend + guest memory | S | no |
| Renderer statistics | per ordering-table bucket: packets, primitives, GS state changes, draw calls, time; VU1 program used | renderer | M | no |
| Framebuffer / GS VRAM viewer | render targets (main, shadow 0x2500, glow, small targets FBP 0x120–0x1C0), uploaded textures with CLUT, by page/PSM | renderer RT cache | M | no |
| Live session log | the session log (ADR-005) with filters (module, level) | log sink | S | no |
| *Extra:* game TTY | output of the game's own `printf` calls (shipping debug prints, e.g. `func_00250C30`, the movie-stream "CH0/CH2" warning, the MTXT version warning), invisible on a retail PS2 | `printf` in the libc shim | S | no |
| *Extra:* `sce*` call counters | per SDK function: calls this frame/total, unimplemented hits | `src/sce/` | S | no |
| *Extra:* object inspector | flight units (pointer table 0x002A1F70: position, speed, HP, AI state), projectile and effect pools with slot occupancy | guest memory + struct metadata | M | no |
| *Extra:* save image inspector | the save image (`../formats/SAVE.md`) decoded field by field, before/after a save, checksum check | `saves\` + format code | M | no |
| *Extra:* determinism checker | hash of guest RAM regions after each simulation step, written to a file; two runs (or port vs. replay) compared step by step to find the first divergence | `GuestMemory` | M | no |
| *Extra:* native screenshot | saves the native 512×448 (or N×) frame before the output pass, for comparison with PCSX2 screenshots; output goes to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ProjectStonehenge\screenshots\`, never the repo | renderer | S | no |

#### 8.4.2 Control

| Feature | What it does | Effort | Sim |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pause and single-step | pauses the **simulation step and the audio clock together**; "step" runs exactly one 59.94 Hz step (one PS2 frame). Presentation keeps running so the overlay stays usable | S | **guarded**: no step is skipped or repeated, so results equal an uninterrupted run. Wall-clock-dependent paths (none found: the game counts frames) would be the only risk |
| Toggle render buckets | hide a bucket / table (terrain, effects, HUD, sky…) in the renderer | S | **guarded**: only the GPU replay skips it. The draw-list build still runs (it consumes `rand` and the random table and changes state, `../subsystems/effects.md`, ADR-002). Never implemented by skipping game draw functions |
| Jump to scene | calls the translated `RequestScene(n, sub)` at the start of the next step, including the dead **scenes 1 and 3** (`SceneMenuEntry`, `SceneMovie`) to explore cut content (`dead-code.md`) | M | **yes**: changes game state; scene 3 needs `ret_scene` set first (dead `SetReturnScene` 0x00100B08) |
| RAM diff against a PCSX2 save state | loads `eeMemory.bin` from a `.p2s` (uncompressed, as `tools/p2s_read.py`) and diffs it with guest RAM, region by region, with symbol names; only reads the state file the user picks | M | no (read-only) |
| *Extra:* memory poke | edit a value in the memory viewer / watch list | S | **yes** |
| *Extra:* breakpoint on guest write | stop the simulation when a watched guest address is written (debug builds have write-watch, ADR-001) | M | **guarded** (pauses only) |
| *Extra:* random-read trace | log every `NextRandomFloat` read of one frame with caller address, to compare with a PCSX2 trace | S | no |

#### 8.4.3 Later

| Feature | Notes | Effort | Sim |
|---|---|---|---|
| Save states | snapshot of guest RAM + scratchpad + all `src/sce/`/platform service state (CD queue, audio voices, VAG streams, pad, timers). Straightforward with guest memory (ADR-001); the service state is the work | L | **yes** on load |
| Mission select | sets the mission id and enters the mission through the game's own menu path (`MissionSelectAction` 0x0023AC70) | M | **yes** |
| Free camera | a **presentation-side** camera: the renderer replays the step's draw lists with its own view matrix (ADR-002 records the per-node world matrices). It never writes the game camera, so lock-on and HUD projection are unchanged | L | **guarded** |
| *Extra:* input recording/playback | record pad bytes per step and play them back (with the determinism checker, a regression test) | M | **yes** on playback (replaces input) |
| *Extra:* GS frame capture | write the frame's GIF/VIF packets in PCSX2 `.gs` dump format, to compare with PCSX2 GS dumps in the same tools | M | no |

### 8.5 Rules

- Part of the debug layer: compiled in, **inactive** unless `overlay_enabled` is true and the overlay is opened.
- Reading never mutates guest memory or service state (no read side effects: e.g. reading the random cursor must not call `NextRandomFloat`).
- Every "yes" action is logged and marks the session as modified.
- No game data leaves the process: no dumps into the repo, screenshots and traces go to the user data folder.

### 8.6 User decisions

1. Approve Dear ImGui as a dependency (`../decisions/dependencies.md`).
2. Require `overlay_enabled` in `settings.json` (proposed: **yes**, default false).
3. Which features go in the first version (proposed: the S items of 4.1, pause/step, bucket toggles, memory viewer, RAM diff).

### 8.7 Implemented (milestone D)

Code: `src/platform/debug/overlay.{h,cpp}`; hook for scene requests: `src/common/debug_hooks.{h,cpp}` (called by the translated `RequestScene`/`RequestSubState`, records only). Dear ImGui v1.92.9b (`../decisions/dependencies.md`).

- **Enable:** `settings.json` `"debug": {"overlay_enabled": true}` (default on in development builds, off in release), or `--debug-overlay` / `--no-debug-overlay` for one session. With it off, no ImGui context or GPU resource is created. Changing the setting while the port runs creates or destroys the overlay.
- **Toggle:** the typed character in `"overlay_toggle"` (default `"\"`, matched on SDL text input, so any keyboard layout works), or `"key:<SDL scancode name>"` (e.g. `"key:F12"`).
- **Input:** while an overlay window has keyboard focus, the keyboard is not mapped to the game's pad; gamepads still reach the game.
- **Look:** square style (every rounding 0, border 1), drawn in the output pass after the game image at host resolution. `imgui.ini` is not written (`IniFilename = nullptr`).
- **Panels** (all read-only, "Sim: no"):
  - *Performance:* presented fps and frame-time graph (240 frames), the "FPS overlay (top right)" checkbox, the renderer's CPU time of the last frame (GS processing, recording) and its texture statistics (textures drawn, GPU decodes, CPU uploads, GPU memory updates, KiB uploaded, texture images held and their MiB; §6), steps this frame, total steps, dropped steps (catch-up limit 4), interpolation alpha, DMA intake per step (GIF/VIF1 qwords, sends, bad chains), last DISPFB/DISPLAY.
  - *Scene:* scene and name, sub-state, previous/next scene, `req`, flags, `frame_count`/`scene_frame` (and unpaused), mission id, and the last 64 `RequestScene`/`RequestSubState` calls with step, `frame_count` and requesting scene.
  - *Memory:* 32 rows of 16 bytes at a PS2 address, as bytes+ASCII, u32 or f32; go to a hex address or an exact symbol name; each row labelled with the symbol it belongs to. Only RAM and scratchpad are read (never hardware registers). Symbols: `docs/symbols.csv` of the source tree in development builds, or an optional `symbols.csv` next to the executable (read only).
  - *Session log:* the last 400 log lines with a text filter; errors and warnings coloured.
- **Frame-rate overlay** (2026-10-20): FPS and mean frame time over the last half second, small text at the top right of the window, drawn without a window or background (`DrawFps`). On with `--fps-overlay`, `debug.fps_overlay` or the Performance panel's checkbox; it also works with the panels disabled (release builds), then only the ImGui context is created (§7).
- **Not yet** (later items of §8.4): pause/single-step, bucket toggles, RAM diff against a `.p2s`, the other read-only panels.

#### 8.7.1 Changes after the hands-on test (2026-10-22, `validation.md` §2q)
- **Toggle after a text field:** `imgui_impl_sdl3` stops SDL text input when a text field loses focus, and the toggle character arrives as text input, so after typing in the Memory address or log filter field `\` no longer worked. Text input is switched on again after every ImGui frame (`DebugOverlay::EndFrame`).
- **UI scale:** the scalable default font and every size are scaled with the window height (1 up to 1080 lines, 2 at 2160, quarter steps), also the frame-rate overlay; it follows window size changes.
- **Default layout** (1080-line units): Debug top left, Performance below it, Scene and Memory side by side at the top, Session log under Performance; nothing overlaps at 16:9.
- **Keyboard on opening:** opening the panels focuses none of them, so the keyboard keeps driving the game until a panel is clicked.
- Scene: the request table fills the window, the request column (with its argument) gets most of the width, the header row stays visible; mission id in hex and decimal.
- Memory: the row of the address or symbol looked up is highlighted; the label column fits at the default size.
- Session log: the filter ignores case.
- Main window title "Debug" (was "AC04 debug").

## 9. QUIT GAME (main menu, campaign menu)

The last item of the main menu's first column, after OPTIONS (User request 2026-10-22), and of the campaign menu's first column, after LOAD (User request 2026-10-24: the menu after a mission). Code: `src/game/quit_item.*`, hooks marked `port:` in `src/game/menu.cpp` and `src/game/campaign_menu_page.cpp`; one in `src/game/menu_widgets.cpp`.

- Drawn by the game's own menu tree: the column-0 definition gets the item only while the tree is built or its cursors are stored (`QuitItemPatch`, as GRAPHICS in §3), and the item ids are mapped back to the game's (`MainMenuSelection`). It is typed in, highlighted and wrapped over like the other items. Items the port adds do not lengthen a column's typing (`UpdateListWidget`), so its duration and typing sounds stay the game's.
- Selecting it plays the select sound and fades the menu, the screen and the menu BGM out (0.5 s, port state 9); then the host ends the session as when the window is closed (`port::Menu().quit`).
- The help line is empty on it: the game's help texts are glyph messages of the page's font block, which has none for it.
- Not added in validation runs (development runs with a pad script, an input log, a PCSX2 recording, `--memcard` or `--no-memcard`; `port::Boot().quit_item`), the rule of the SCREEN RATIO default (§2): with the item, the main menu's tree and draw packets left in RAM differ from the PS2's (`validation.md` §2v). The session log says `QUIT GAME in the main menu: on` or `off (validation run)`.

## 10. Save texts for a computer

The save, load and format messages are reworded just enough for a computer (User request 2026-10-22; wording chosen by the User). Code: `src/game/pc_texts.*`, one `port:` line in `LoadFontBlock` (`src/game/message_window.cpp`).

- "memory card (PS2)" becomes "memory card" (about 40 messages: "Accessing memory card...", "Insert a memory card", "Insufficient space on memory card", ...); the warning shown while saving, loading and formatting reads "Do not remove memory card / or switch off the computer" (was "... (PS2) / or switch off power").
- Done in guest memory right after a page's messages are indexed: a message that gets shorter is changed in place, a longer one is written into the port menu area (§5, slots 22-31) and its message table entry points there; the disc data is not changed. Messages use the game's glyph codes (`../subsystems/sound.md` "Text engine").
- Not changed: the hard disk drive texts ("(for PlayStation 2)", "Do not turn power off"), unreachable in the release.
- Not applied in validation runs, the rule of §9 (the startup log line "QUIT GAME in the main menu and save texts for a computer: on / off").
