// Port-added menu content (port baseline, User approval 2026-10-20; docs/decisions/port-baseline.md):
// the Modern control types on CONTROLLER SETUP (slots 0-3), the GRAPHICS page under SCREEN SETTINGS
// (4-19), QUIT GAME in the main menu (20-21, 2026-10-22) and reworded save texts that grew (22-31,
// pc_texts.h). Their values come from common/port_hooks.h, never from settings.
//
// The game draws texts and menu items from guest addresses, so the strings and tables of these
// additions live in a port-owned guest area above the initial stack pointer (0x01FFF800-0x01FFFFFF,
// guest_stack.h): the game never reads or writes it. It is written only while one of these pages
// is open, so RAM elsewhere stays as on the PS2.
