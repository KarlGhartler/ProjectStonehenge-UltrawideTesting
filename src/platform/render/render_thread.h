// Render thread (ADR-002: presentation decoupled from the simulation; validation.md §2ai RT-1).
//
// The main thread runs the game's ticks (the game thread in lockstep), samples input and keeps the
// clock; the render thread turns the frame's GS data into a presented picture: GS processing,
// frame interpolation, Vulkan recording, submit and present. A frame's work for the render thread
// is one FrameJob, built by the main thread while the game is parked: it holds only copies (the
// steps' GIF streams, the display registers, the movie picture), never guest memory, so the game
// cannot see where or when it is drawn. At most one frame is in flight: Submit hands a job over only
// after the previous one has been presented, so v-sync still paces the main loop and the picture
// trails the game by at most one frame.
//
// Buffers travel back with the finished job (Submit returns it) and are put back into the game
// side's pools by the main thread while the game is parked.
